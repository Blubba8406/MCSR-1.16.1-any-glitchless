hii there :)\
Below you will find a list of resources to help you find your way around MCSR.\
MCSR has evolved rapidly in recent months and years. New strategies and techniques are enabling runners to become faster and faster. In my opinion, the recent worldrecordholders and top-runners would not have been able to achieve this level without a community that is creative and eager to experiment, share information and ideas, while laughing and crying with their competing runners at their wins and chokes.

There is information on MCSR scattered all over the internet (unfortunately often a little confusing; it is therefore worth seeking personal contact with the community, e.g. via discord). On youtube, for example, there are numerous tutorials on bastion routes, on pie- and E-raying, on completing ruined netherportals, on the hitboxes of the enderdragon, on the stuff that aggros piglins, on how to death reset and so on and so forth. To learn MCSR, such tutorials are incredibly helpful. But as a noobie you sometimes almost drown in the flood of information. It's not uncommon that someone learns how to do something only to find out later, that this strategy is now completely outdated and the tools for it no longer work. What a pity.

So therefore, dear reader, be aware of this! **Pay attention to the creation date of tutorials.** And if you are looking for something specific ask someone in the community. They are usually very supportive ♡
